# Deiv: Through the Lens of Roro

Welcome to the most groundbreaking gallery and love letter you've ever seen on GitHub. If you were expecting some boring portfolio, well... buckle up, because this is a rollercoaster of emotions, screenshots, and floating hearts.

## What is this?

- A gallery so packed with screenshots that you'll question your browser's dedication.
- A love letter typed out with painstaking slowness (because who likes instant gratification anyway?).
- A floating hearts animation that follows your cursor everywhere, like a clingy ex but way more romantic.
- An audio player playing "Paper Rings" by Taylor Swift to serenade you while you admire the chaos.

## Why should you care?

Honestly, you shouldn't. But here we are. Maybe for the sheer audacity of mixing frontend magic with undying love declarations? Or maybe because you accidentally clicked on this repo and now you're too curious to leave.

## Files included:

- `index.html` - Your gateway to the screenshot abyss.
- `next.html` - The love letter, the music, the feels.
- `styles.css` - Our caramel & beige themed fashion statement in CSS form.
- `script.js` - The guy that makes the magic happen (dragging galleries, floating hearts, typing... basically the party starter).
- Screenshot images - Because a picture is worth a thousand words, and this gallery is a novel.
- MP3 file - We don't just speak love; we sing it.

## How to use this beast?

1. Clone it. If you're brave.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser (support dragons, older browsers may cry).
3. Drag the gallery like you mean it.
4. Hit the button... if you've got the heart.
5. Sit back, listen to Taylor, watch the hearts float away, and pretend this is the most important project you've ever opened.

## Deployment?

You can host this love letter and gallery anywhere that serves static files.

- GitHub Pages? Easy. Just push and enable Pages.
- Netlify / Vercel? The pros do it.
- Your laptop? Sure, why not.

## Final words

If you got this far, thanks for enduring this rollercoaster of devotion, pixels, and JavaScript. May your hearts float freely and your galleries scroll forever.

Love and sarcastic hugs,  
Deiv's code (and heart ðŸ’–).
